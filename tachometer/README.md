# Tachometer Complex Example

[Tachometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachometer) measures the speed of a vehicle (bus, truck, etc.).

## Requirements

### Minimum Viable Product 

 - As a driver, I want to record a route with start time and speed measurements so that the route can be queried and analyzed. 
 - As a driver, I want to query a route by id so that I can check the report of the route.

### Optional

 - As a driver, I want to check the speed limit violations in the report.
 - As a driver, I want to get statistical report from the route.
 - As a driver, I want to see my speed in a line chart.

#### Note: User Story
As a __role__, I want to __do something__, so that __benefit__.


#### Note: Tachometer Recording

```json
{
  "driver": "John Doe",
  "vehicle": "ABC-123",
  "start": "2021-10-15 13:26:32",
  "speed": [0,0,1,3] 
}
```
The _speed_ contains a measurement for each seconds.
The _start_ is a string in _YYYY-mm-dd HH-MM-SS_ format.
